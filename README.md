# Next generation matrix widget

## Overview

This repo contains code for investigating the potential efficacy of vaccination allocation for a disease interactively via a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app using a next generation matrix approach.

## Getting started

- Enable [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) with `poetry install`
- To run the app: `make`, which calls `streamlit run scripts/app.py`
- In a browser, visit: `http://localhost:8501/`

### Using containers

- Build and tag the image: `make build_container`
- Run the container: `make run_container`
- Note the port 8501 is hard-coded in the `Dockerfile`

## Model Description

This repo contains code to apply the next-generation method of Diekman et al. (1990) to calculate R0 for an SIR model with 3 risk groups and flexible inputs for varying vaccine allocation to each group.

### Next generation matrix calculation

The next-generation matrix approach (NGM) is described in `docs/ngm.md`. The documentation is best viewed off of GitHub, either by opening in VSCode and using the built in [markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) or by building with `mkdocs` using `mkdocs serve` (this requires installing `mkdocs`).

### Model assumptions

Vaccination is assumed to be all or nothing -- each individual's immunity is determined by a coin flip with probability of being immune equal to the vaccine efficacy.

### Widget

The widget is designed to let users modify vaccine allocation choices, measures of between- and within-group spread, population composition, and see how this effects $R_e$ and other key quantities.

Specific inputs to and outputs from the widget are documented therein.
