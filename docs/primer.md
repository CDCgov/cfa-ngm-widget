# A Primer on Next Generation Matrix Models

A Next Generation Matrix model is a way to model the expected number of infections generated by a single infected individual in different groups or categories of the population per unit time in consecutive generations. The Next Generation Matrix (here after referred to as the NGM) encodes this information. NGM models are an effective way to model average dynamics during the early growth phase of an epidemic in the limit of the disease-free equilibrium.

An NGM model is akin to the branching process concept of an offspring distribution generated by an individual. In this context, the NGM represents the expected value of the offspring distribution, or in this case the distribution of infections caused in a group from an infectious individual in another group.

## Use of NGM as a model
Most commonly, NGM models are used as an analytical tool to estimate the basic reproduction number $R_0$, an epidemiological quantity that can help provide insight about disease dynamics during outbreaks and how to design interventions to control or mitigate them, from the NGM.

As a result, most modelers familiar with NGM models have experience with using them as an analytical tool rather than as a simulation tool. NGMs can also be used to approximately model the ODEs for the subsystem of infected states, where the unit of time is the infectious period.

## Interpretation of matrix elements
Imagine we have an NGM, **M** = [$m_{ij}$]. The elements $m_{ij}$ of this matrix can be interpreted as the average number of infections in group $i$ caused by an infected individual in group $j$. The matrix **M** is not inherently symmetric; some groups may be more susceptible to infection or more transmissive resulting in an asymmetric **M**.
